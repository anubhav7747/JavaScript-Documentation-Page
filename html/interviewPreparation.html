                        <h1>What is JavaScript?</h1>
                        <p>JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted scripting language primarily used for web development to create interactive and dynamic web pages. JavaScript runs in browsers and can be used for server-side with environments like Node.js.</p>
                    </li>
                    
                    <hr>

                    <li>
                        <h1>How would you explain the difference between JavaScript and ECMAScript?</h1>
                        <p>The difference between JavaScript and ECMAScript is that JavaScript is a general-purpose scripting language, while ECMAScript (often abbreviated as ES) is the standardized specification that defines its core features. Think of ECMAScript as the blueprint and JavaScript as one of the implementations of that blueprint.</p>
                    </li>
                    
                    <hr>
                    
                    <li>
                        <h1>How is JavaScript different from Java?</h1>
                        <p>The difference between JavaScript and Java is that Java is an OOP programming language while JavaScript is an OOP scripting language. JavaScript is interpreted and follows dynamic typing. Java is compiled and strongly typed.</p>
                    </li>
                    
                    <hr>
                    
                    <li>
                        <h1>What are the primitive data types in JavaScript?</h1>
                        <p>The primitive data types in JavaScript are string, number, boolean, undefined, null, symbol, Object, and BigInt.</p>
                    </li>
                    
                    <hr>
                    
                    <li>
                        <h1>How would you explain the concept of undefined in JavaScript?</h1>
                        <p>Undefined in JavaScript is a primitive value automatically assigned to variables that have been declared but not yet initialized. It represents the absence of a defined value.</p>
                    </li>
                    
                    <hr>
                    
                    <li>
                        <h1>What is null in JavaScript?</h1>
                        <p>Null in JavaScript is a special value that signifies no value or no object. It needs to be explicitly set and denotes the intentional absence of any value.</p>
                    </li>
                    
                    <hr>
                    
                    <li>
                        <h1>How can you differentiate null from undefined?</h1>
                        <p>You can differentiate null from undefined as undefined is the default state of a declared variable that hasn't been assigned a value, whereas null is an explicit assignment indicating the deliberate absence of a value.</p>
                    </li>
                    
                    <hr>
                    
                    <li>
                        <h1>What is NaN? How can you check if a value is NaN?</h1>
                        <p>NaN stands for "Not-a-Number" and indicates a value that cannot be represented as a valid number. To check if a value is NaN, use the global function NaN() or the more reliable Number is NaN().</p>
                    </li>
                    
                    <hr>
                    
                    <li>
                        <h1>Explain variable hoisting.</h1>
                        <p>Variable Hoisting is a concept or behavior in JavaScript where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase.</p>
                    </li>
                    
                    <hr>
                    
                    <li>
                        <h1>What is the difference between let, const, and var?</h1>
                        <p>The difference between let, const, and var is that var declarations are globally scoped or function scoped while let and const are block scoped. var and let allows for reassignment, const creates a read-only reference, meaning the value it holds cannot be changed after declaration.</p>
                    </li>
                    
                    <hr>
                    
                    <li>
                        <h1>What is an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)?</h1>
                        <p>An Immediately Invoked Function Expression (or IIFE) is a JavaScript function that is defined and executed immediately after its creation.</p>
                    </li>
                    
                    <hr>
                    
                    <li>
                        <h1>How can you explain closures in JavaScript?</h1>
                        <p>Closures in JavaScript are functions which retains access to variables from its enclosing scope, even after that outer function has finished executing.</p>
                    </li>
                    
                    <hr>
                    
                    <li>
                        <h1>What is the this keyword? How does it work?</h1>
                        <p>The this keyword in JavaScript refers to the current execution context or the object that the function is bound to. The value of this keyword changes if its call type is a method, constructor or a standalone function.</p>
                    </li>
                    
                    <hr>
                    
                    <li>
                        <h1>How does bind(), call(), and apply() work?</h1>
                        <p>bind(), call(), and apply() are methods used to change the context of this keyword within a function. bind() creates a new function with a specified this value, while call() and apply() immediately invoke the function with the provided this value and arguments.</p>
                    </li>
                    
                    <hr>
                    
                    <li>
                        <h1>What is the prototype chain?</h1>
                        <p>The prototype chain is a mechanism that defines how objects inherit properties and methods from their prototype objects. JavaScript looks up the prototype chain to find it in higher-level prototypes, when a property or method is not found on an object.</p>
                    </li>
                    
                    <hr>
                    
                    <li>
                        <h1>How can you explain event delegation?</h1>
                        <p>Event delegation is a method where a single event handler is placed on a common parent element of multiple child elements. The parent element captures and handles events triggered by the child elements.</p>
                    </li>
                    
                    <hr>
                    
                    <li>
                        <h1>What are JavaScript Promises?</h1>
                        <p>JavaScript Promises are objects representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. Promises in JavaScript provide a cleaner and more structured way to handle asynchronous code compared to callback functions, making it easier to work with asynchronous tasks like HTTP requests.</p>
                    </li>
                    
                    <hr>
                    
                    <li>
                        <h1>How do you handle errors in JavaScript?</h1>
                        <p>Use try-catch block to handle errors in JavaScript. Errors are thrown explicitly using the throw statement. The try statement is used to define a code block to be executed. The catch statement defines a code block that handles any errors that occur during execution. The finally block defines a code block that should always be executed, regardless of the outcome of the try statement. The throw statement can be used to define a custom error caught and handled by the catch statement.</p>
                    </li>
                    
                    <hr>
                    
                    <li>
                        <h1>How does the Event Loop work in JavaScript?</h1>
                        <p>Event Loop in JavaScript continuously checks the call stack for executed functions and the message queue for events or tasks to process ensuring that JavaScript remains single-threaded while handling asynchronous operations efficiently.</p>
                    </li>
                    
                    <hr>
                    
                    <li>
                        <h1>What is the difference between == and ===?</h1>
                        <p>The difference between == and === in JavaScript is that == is a loose equality operator that compares values after type coercion, while === is a strict equality operator that compares both values and types. === requires both values to be of the same type and have the same value, making it a safer choice for most comparisons to avoid unexpected type conversions.</p>
                    </li>
                    
                    <hr>

                    <li>
                        <h1>How can you explain the importance of the use strict directive?</h1>
                        <p>The importance of use strict directive is that it enforces a stricter set of rules and helps catch common coding mistakes. It prevents the use of undeclared variables, eliminates ambiguous behavior, and encourages a cleaner, more reliable codebase.</p>
                    </li>
                    
                    <hr>
                    
                    <li>
                        <h1>How would you explain the concept of Callback Hell or Pyramid of Doom?</h1>
                        <p>Callback Hell, or Pyramid of Doom, occurs when multiple nested callback functions are used in asynchronous JavaScript code, leading to deeply indented and hard-to-read code structures making code maintenance and debugging challenging.</p>
                    </li>
                    
                    <hr>

                    <li>
                        <h1>How do you avoid Callback Hell?</h1>
                        <p>To avoid callback Hell use Promises, async/await, or modularize the code into smaller functions.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h1>What is a callback function?</h1>
                        <p>A callback function is a function passed as an argument to another function, which is then invoked or executed at a later point in the program's execution.</p>
                    </li>
                    
                    <hr>
                    
                    <li>
                        <h1>Can you explain how map, reduce, and filter methods work?</h1>
                        <p>map(), reduce(), and filter() are array methods in JavaScript. map() transforms each element in an array into a new array based on a provided function.reduce() reduces an array to a single value by applying a function cumulatively to elements.filter() creates a new array with elements that pass a given test.</p>
                    </li>
                    
                    <hr>
                    
                    <li>
                        <h1>What is a closure? Can you give a practical example?</h1>
                        <p>Closure in JavaScript is when a function retains access to variables from its enclosing scope, even after that outer function has finished executing. Practical examples include creating private variables and functions in JavaScript, maintaining state in event handlers, and implementing data hiding patterns.</p>
                    </li>
                    
                    <hr>
                    
                    <li>
                        <h1>How do you clone an object in JavaScript?</h1>
                        <p>To clone an object in JavaScript use methods like Object.assign(), the spread operator (...), or by create a custom cloning functions.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h1>Can you explain how to create and use JavaScript Promises?</h1>
                        <p>To create a Promise, use the Promise constructor with two parameters: resolve and reject. Then use .then() and .catch() to handle successful and failed outcomes, respectively.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h1>How does JavaScript handle asynchronous operations?</h1>
                        <p>JavaScript handles asynchronous operations using mechanisms like callbacks, Promises, async/await, and the Event Loop.</p>
                    </li>

                        <h1>What distinguishes a function expression from a function declaration?</h1>
                        <p>A function expression is distinguished from a function declaration as function declaration defines a named function with a specific name and is hoisted to the top of its containing scope. A function expression assigns an anonymous or named function to a variable, and it is not hoisted.</p>
